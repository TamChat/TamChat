# Hiring #
So if you wanna join the TamChat community and be a coder you will have to follow these:
1. Good in coding
2. Can help us make projects
3. Has some creativeness

# Product making #

So we allow you to use AI tools and assistants to help you code so you can make products BUT you arent allowed to use them too much
Using AI tools more than actually coding can get you kicked from this group

# Rewarding #
We will reward people who are helping our products grow/improving them or doing great good to them. But we cant pay you via cash so
We reward people by giving them more roles in the group and more control over it and we may reward if can
